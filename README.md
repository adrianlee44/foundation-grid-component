Foundation Grid Component
===

[Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) is a great front-end framework but it comes with a lot of components. If one wants to just use the grid component of Foundation, he/she must compile from source. This package precompiles just the grid component and has backfilled all of v5.


## Quickstart

* [Download directly from Github](https://github.com/adrianlee44/foundation-grid-component)
* [Install with Bower](http://bower.io): `bower install foundation-grid-component`

## Documentation
